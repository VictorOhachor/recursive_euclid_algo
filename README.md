# Euclidian Algorithm

This is an python implementation of the Euclidian algorithm using recursion.

## What is the Euclidian Algorithm?

This algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Finding the GCD of two small numbers is easy, but when the numbers become really large, it becomes difficult or impossible to find the GCD for such numbers.

## Using the Script

This script uses the euclidian algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. See the example below to use the program.

```bash
$ python euclid_algo.py 1005 105
